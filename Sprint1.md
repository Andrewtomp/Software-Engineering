### Back end

## Completed Issues
### Front end
1. Completed interfaces for creating an account and logging in
2. Completed UI for dashboard so users can see a preview of their products, storefronts, and orders
3. Continuously making the application accessible for users on different platforms

### Back end

## Incomplete Issues
### Front end
1. Have not created the form to create a product as the back end functionality is not present yet.
   - We did however, create the products page where users can see an overview of their products and have the option to make a new one.
   - Leaves **Issue #6** incomplete
2. We have not linked the dashboard to real information pulled from the back end as the functionality does not exist yet. Currently just dummy data.
   - Leaves **Issue #11** incomplete
